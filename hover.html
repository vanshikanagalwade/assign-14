        In the quiet town of Marbury, the last train pulled into the station. Emma, clutching a worn .<br>suitcase,
        hesitated before stepping aboard. The train was nearly empty, save for a few tired.<br> travelers. She found a
        seat by the window, watching the familiar landscape blur into the .<br>night.<br>

        Emma was leaving everything behind: the small bakery she’d run for years, the memories of .<br>a love long gone.
        As the train chugged forward, a sense of liberation washed over her..<br> She didn’t know where the tracks would
        lead, but for the first time in years, she felt the.<br> thrill of endless possibility..<br>
